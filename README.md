This password generator allows the user to choose the following criteria:
    1. How many characters long it should be (must be between 8 and 128 characters)
    2. If it should contain uppercase characters, lowercase characters, numbers, OR symbols.  

It will repeat a new random password until all the criteria the user selected are validated.  After they're validated, it will show the user the final password.  

There is also a button that will copy the final password to the user's clipboard.
